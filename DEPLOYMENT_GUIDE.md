## Development (localhost)

For local development without HTTPS (HTTP only).

### 1. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=testpass123
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Use localhost - no HTTPS
HUBBLE_DOMAIN=localhost
# Leave email empty for development
HUBBLE_TRAEFIK_EMAIL=
```

### 2. Start Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Access Services

- **Web UI:** http://hubble.localhost
- **API:** http://hubble.localhost/api
- **Registry:** http://registry.localhost


### 4. Add to /etc/hosts (if needed)

If `*.localhost` doesn't work, add to `/etc/hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1 hubble.localhost
127.0.0.1 registry.localhost
```

**Note:** Browsers will show "Not Secure" because there's no HTTPS. This is expected for local development.

## Production (with HTTPS)

For production deployment with automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt.

### Prerequisites

1. **Public domain** pointing to your server (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
2. **DNS records** configured:
   ```
   A    hubble.yourdomain.com    → your-server-ip
   A    registry.yourdomain.com  → your-server-ip
   ```
3. **Ports open:** 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
4. **Valid email** for Let's Encrypt notifications

### 1. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=production
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Your actual domain
HUBBLE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com

# Required for Let's Encrypt
HUBBLE_TRAEFIK_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com

# Enable HTTPS (required for production)
HUBBLE_HTTPS_REDIRECT=https-redirect
HUBBLE_CERT_RESOLVER=letsencrypt
```

### 2. Start Services (Production Mode)

**IMPORTANT:** Run this on your production server, NOT your local development machine!

```bash
# Simply use docker compose - the .env file controls the behavior
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify HTTPS Certificates

Watch Traefik logs to see Let's Encrypt certificate generation:
```bash
docker compose logs -f hubble-traefik
```

You should see:
```
[acme] Register...
[acme] Trying to solve HTTP-01
[acme] The server validated our request
[acme] Certificate obtained successfully
```

This process takes 30-60 seconds. Once complete, your sites will have valid HTTPS certificates!

### 4. Access Services (HTTPS)

- **Web UI:** https://hubble.yourdomain.com
- **API:** https://hubble.yourdomain.com/api
- **Registry:** https://registry.yourdomain.com


### 5. Test Docker Registry

Login to your private registry:
```bash
docker login registry.yourdomain.com -u admin -p your-password
```

Push an image:
```bash
docker tag myapp:latest registry.yourdomain.com/myapp:latest
docker push registry.yourdomain.com/myapp:latest
```

## Configuration Comparison

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Domain | `localhost` | `yourdomain.com` |
| Protocol | HTTP (port 80) | HTTPS (port 443) |
| Certificates | None | Let's Encrypt |
| HTTPS Redirect | Disabled (`HUBBLE_HTTPS_REDIRECT=`) | Enabled (`HUBBLE_HTTPS_REDIRECT=https-redirect`) |
| Cert Resolver | Disabled (`HUBBLE_CERT_RESOLVER=`) | Enabled (`HUBBLE_CERT_RESOLVER=letsencrypt`) |
| Email Required | No | Yes |
| Secure Cookies | No | Yes |
| Docker Compose | `docker compose up -d` | `docker compose up -d` |

## Troubleshooting

### "Site Not Secure" in Browser

**Development (localhost):**
- Expected behavior! Let's Encrypt doesn't issue certificates for localhost
- Access via HTTP: `http://hubble.localhost`
- Browser will show "Not Secure" - this is normal

**Production (real domain):**
- Check DNS: `dig hubble.yourdomain.com` should return your server IP
- Check ports: `netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(80|443)'`
- Check Traefik logs: `docker compose logs hubble-traefik`
- Verify email is set: `grep HUBBLE_TRAEFIK_EMAIL .env`

### Let's Encrypt Rate Limits

If testing repeatedly, you may hit rate limits (5 certificates per week per domain). Use Let's Encrypt staging server for testing:

Add to `docker-compose.prod.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  hubble-traefik:
    command:
      # ... existing commands ...
      - --certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

Remove this line once everything works!

### Certificate Not Generating

**Common cause:** Running production config on local machine instead of production server!

Let's Encrypt needs to access your domain from the internet. If you're testing on your local PC, it will fail. Deploy to your production server first.

1. **Verify you're on production server:**
   ```bash
   # Check your public IP matches DNS
   curl ifconfig.me
   dig +short hubble.yourdomain.com
   # These should match!
   ```

2. **Check DNS propagation:**
   ```bash
   dig hubble.yourdomain.com
   dig registry.yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Check ports are accessible from internet:**
   ```bash
   # From your local machine (NOT the server)
   curl -I http://hubble.yourdomain.com
   ```

4. **Check email is set:**
   ```bash
   grep HUBBLE_TRAEFIK_EMAIL .env
   ```

5. **Check Traefik logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs hubble-traefik | grep -i error
   ```

### "Connection Refused" Error

- Check all services are running: `docker compose ps`
- Check Traefik routes: `http://localhost:8080` (dashboard)
- Check service labels: `docker inspect hubble-server | grep traefik`

### Registry Push Fails

1. **Check you're logged in:**
   ```bash
   docker login registry.yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Check registry is accessible:**
   ```bash
   curl -u admin:password https://registry.yourdomain.com/v2/_catalog
   ```

3. **Check firewall/DNS:**
   ```bash
   ping registry.yourdomain.com
   ```

## Switching Between Environments

### Development → Production

```bash
# Stop development stack
docker compose down

# Copy production template and update values
cp .env.production .env
vim .env  # Update passwords, secrets, domain, email

# Start production stack
docker compose up -d
```

### Production → Development

```bash
# Stop production stack
docker compose down

# Update .env with development values (or use .env.example as template)
cp .env.example .env
vim .env

# Start development stack
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Best Practices

### Development
- ✅ Use `HUBBLE_DOMAIN=localhost`
- ✅ Leave `HUBBLE_TRAEFIK_EMAIL` empty
- ✅ Access via HTTP (`http://`)
- ✅ Use simple passwords for testing

### Production
- ✅ Use real domain (e.g., `HUBBLE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com`)
- ✅ Set valid email for Let's Encrypt notifications
- ✅ Use strong passwords (min 16 chars)
- ✅ Use strong JWT secrets (`openssl rand -base64 32`)
- ✅ Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` for secure cookies
- ✅ Enable firewall (allow 80, 443, 22 only)
- ✅ Keep `.env` secure (never commit to git)
- ✅ Backup volumes regularly
